"""
We're going to do some practice with Strings!

In class we talked about:
 - indexing Strings (getting one letter)
 - slicing Strings (getting a few letters)
 - making Strings uppercase (do you remember how to do this? check the slides if you forgot!)

The string we're going to work with in this assignment is "perpetual".

For each problem, I'll ask how you would print out a certain part of this string. Or, I'll give you a
print statement and ask what it will print out.

You can use the shell to check your answers. Once you've solved them, send me your answers!

I've done the first two as an example.
