[Week 9] Project Discussions
============================

This week will be looking at your projects to see how far you've come and what you have left.
You should have a working demo!

We will be discussing your final presentations today 
and what information should be in it. 
In addition to your final presentation, 
you will be required to document your code 
and write a 1 page summary about it. 

You are going to be required to have the following:

    1. A presentation which you will give to your parents. I've included an example one at the bottom of the page to help you with the framework of it. 
    2. A working demo, a screenshot of your demo, or a video/gif of your demo. 
        - If you do the working demo, you have to arrange with me before hand so it goes smoothly
    3. A 1-page paper which summarizes your project.  

Your paper should...

    1. Describe the purpose of your project
    2. Outline the logic of your code
    3. Describe each section in your code
    4. Explain which python syntax you used and why

Your code should...
    
    1. Have docstring comments (the triple-quote strings) describing functions, classes, and sections of your code
    2. Be working!
