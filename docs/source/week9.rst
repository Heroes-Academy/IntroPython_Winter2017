[Week 9] Project Discussions
============================

This week will be looking at your projects to see how far you've come and what you have left.

We will be discussing your final presentations today and what information should be in it. 

You are going to be required to have the following:

    1. A presentation which you will give to your parents. 
    I've included an example one at the bottom of the page to help you with the framework of it. 

Your presentation should...

    1. Describe the purpose of your project
    2. Outline the logic of your code
    3. Explain the types of coding decisions you had to make and why you chose what you did
